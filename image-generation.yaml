    Bria’s Image Generation API provides builders with a flexible and
    controllable way to generate high-quality visuals from textual prompts or
    reference images.

    It supports various resolutions, aspect ratios, and generation speeds,
    enabling scalable and efficient production of photos, illustrations, and
    vector graphics for commercial use.


    **API Access**


    You can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform <a
    href="https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys" target="_blank">by
    clicking here</a>.



    Our latest image generation API (V2) is built around **FIBO**, a next-gen
    visual model trained on structured JSON descriptions of images for precise,
    controllable generation. These endpoints utilize a two-step process:

    1.  A **VLM Bridge** translates your input (text/images) into a detailed,
    machine-readable `structured_prompt` (JSON).

    2.  The **FIBO image model** generates the final image based on the
    `structured_prompt`.


    These APIa offers two VLM bridge options:

    * **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Used by the `/image/generate` endpoints for
    state-of-the-art, detailed prompt creation.

    * **FIBO-VLM (Open):** (Coming Soon) Used by the `/image/generate/lite`
    endpoints as part of the Fibo Lite Pipeline. By pairing the distilled Fibo
    Lite text-to-image model with the FIBO-VLM bridge, the entire pipeline is
    capable of fully local, on-prem deployment. To learn more, contact us at <a
    href="mailto:support@bria.ai">support@bria.ai</a>.


    You can use the all-in-one `/image/generate` endpoints or decouple these
    steps using the `/structured_prompt/generate` endpoints for maximum control
    and automation. See the **v2 endpoints** tag description below for more
    details.


    **V1 Endpoints:**

    We also provide access to our previous generation (V1) endpoints. These
    offer distinct pipelines like Base, Fast, HD, Vector generation, and
    Reimagine. Some V1 endpoints support unique **Guidance Methods** like
    ControlNets. See the **v1 endpoints** tag description below for details on
    these legacy features.



    **IP-related prompts**

    Our models are trained exclusively on fully licensed,
    safe-for-commercial-use data.

    Prompts that reference public figures, brands, or other protected content
    may result in generic or altered outputs.

    These prompts are not blocked, but results may differ from what you expect.

    If an IP-related signal is detected in the prompt, the following warning
    will appear in the API response:

    ```text
      This prompt may contain intellectual property (IP)-protected content. 
      To ensure compliance and safety, certain elements may be omitted or altered. 
      As a result, the output may not fully meet your request.
      ```


    **Advanced Customization and Access:**

    As part of Bria’s **Source Code & Weights** product, developers seeking
    deeper customization can access Bria’s source-available GenAI models via
    [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/briaai).

    This allows full control over fine-tuning, pipeline creation, and
    integration into proprietary workflows—empowering AI teams to develop and
    optimize their own generative AI solutions.

      Our latest image generation API (V2) is built around **FIBO**, a next-gen
      visual model trained on structured JSON descriptions of images for
      precise, controllable generation. 

        **Key Features:**
        * **Structured Control:** Generate images based on detailed JSON prompts for deterministic and auditable results.
        * **VLM Bridge Options:** Choose your intent translation engine:
            * **Gemini 2.5 Flash (Default):** Uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for state-of-the-art understanding. (`/image/generate`, `/structured_prompt/generate`)
            * **FIBO-VLM (Open):** (Coming Soon) Used by the `/image/generate/lite` endpoints as part of the Fibo Lite Pipeline. By pairing the distilled Fibo Lite text-to-image model with the FIBO-VLM bridge, the entire pipeline is capable of fully local, on-prem deployment. To learn more, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bria.ai">support@bria.ai</a>. (`/image/generate/lite`, `/structured_prompt/generate/lite`)

        * **Decoupled Workflow:** Optionally generate the `structured_prompt` first (e.g., `/structured_prompt/generate`) for inspection, editing, automation, or hybrid deployments before generating the image (e.g., `/image/generate`).

        **Asynchronous Requests and the Status Service**

        Bria API v2 endpoints process requests asynchronously by default. When you make an asynchronous request, the API immediately returns a `request_id` and a `status_url` instead of the final result. Use the Status Service to track the request's progress until it reaches a completed state.

        See the full guide at [Status Service Documentation](https://docs.bria.ai/status) for complete details and usage examples.

        **V1 Pipelines Include:**
        * `/text-to-image/base`: Standard image generation.
        * `/text-to-image/fast`: Speed-optimized image generation.
        * `/text-to-image/hd`: High-resolution image generation.
        * `/text-to-vector/base` & `/fast`: Vector graphic generation (Beta).
        * `/reimagine`: Structure-preserving image generation.
        * `/prompt_enhancer`: Utility to enhance simple prompts.

        ### **Guidance Methods**

        Some V1 APIs support guidance methods to provide greater control over generation using visual inputs alongside text prompts.

        The following V1 APIs support guidance methods:

        - `/text-to-image/base`
        - `/text-to-image/fast`
        - `/text-to-vector/base`
        - `/text-to-vector/fast`

        **ControlNets:**
        A set of methods that allow conditioning the model on additional inputs, providing detailed control over image generation.

        - **controlnet_canny**: Uses edge information from the input image to guide generation based on structural outlines.
        - **controlnet_depth**: Derives depth information to influence spatial arrangement in the generated image.
        - **controlnet_recoloring**: Uses a grayscale version of the input image to guide recoloring while preserving geometry.
        - **controlnet_color_grid**: Extracts a 16x16 color grid from the input image to guide the color scheme of the generated image.

        You can specify up to two ControlNet guidance methods in a single request. Each method requires an accompanying image and a scale parameter to determine its impact. When using multiple ControlNets, all input images must have the same aspect ratio.

        To use **ControlNets**, include `guidance_method_X`, `guidance_method_X_scale`, and `guidance_method_X_image_file` parameters.

        **Image Prompt Adapter:**
        Offers two modes for image guidance:

        - **regular**: Uses the image’s content, style, and color palette.
        - **style_only**: Uses only the image’s high-level style and color palette.

        To use **Image Prompt Adapter**, include `image_prompt_mode`, `image_prompt_scale`, and either `image_prompt_file` or `image_prompt_urls`.

        **Description**


        This Image Generation pipeline enables builders to integrate the
        generation of high-quality, photorealistic or artistic images into their
        products. It harnesses the power of Bria’s proprietary text-to-image
        foundation models, enhanced with additional capabilities that optimize
        output quality and provide greater control. The pipeline supports native
        generation at 1MP resolution and accommodates a wide range of aspect
        ratios to fit diverse needs.


        **Examples:**


        **prompt**: A professional headshot of a CEO



        <img

        width="200" height="200"/>        


        **prompt**: A surreal and whimsical food concept photo of a
        sunny-side-up egg clipped to a rope with a wooden clothespin, against a
        bright turquoise background. The yolk is glossy and slightly runny,
        dripping downward, creating a playful and unexpected visual. The
        composition is clean, colorful, and minimalistic, with a creative twist
        that evokes humor and imagination. On the bottom text "Just hanging
        out... Sunny side up!"


        <img

        This API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter
        that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate
        content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked
        input image will fail the entire request.

        **Description**


        This Image Generation pipeline is optimized for speed, enabling builders
        to rapidly generate high-quality, photorealistic or artistic images
        without compromising visual fidelity. It leverages Bria’s proprietary
        text-to-image foundation models, combined with performance-oriented
        enhancements that ensure faster generation while maintaining control and
        flexibility. The pipeline supports native generation at 1MP resolution
        and accommodates a wide range of aspect ratios, making it ideal for
        applications that require quick turnaround with consistent output
        control.



        **An example:**


        **prompt**: A portrait of a Beautiful and playful ethereal singer, art
        deco, fantasy, intricate art deco golden designs, elegant, highly
        detailed, sharp focus, blurry background, teal and orange shades


        **BRIA FAST model 2.3:**

        This API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter
        that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate
        content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked
        input image will fail the entire request.

                    - If some images pass and others fail, returns a 200

        **Description**


        This Image Generation pipeline is designed for builders working on
        projects that demand maximum image detail and clarity. It leverages
        Bria’s proprietary text-to-image foundation models, enhanced to deliver
        high-resolution outputs while preserving control and flexibility. The
        pipeline supports native generation at 1920×1080 resolution (or
        1536×1536 for square aspect ratios) and accommodates a wide range of
        aspect ratios, making it ideal for use cases where visual precision and
        output quality are critical.


        **Examples:**


        **prompt**: A photo of detailed short female blond hair viewed from
        behind, with rich texture and clearly visible individual strands that
        give depth and realism, and featuring subtle waves reflect light


        **BRIA HD model 2.2:**

        **prompt**: A portrait of a Beautiful and playful ethereal singer, art
        deco, fantasy, intricate art deco golden designs, elegant, highly
        detailed, sharp focus, blurry background, teal and orange shades


        **BRIA HD model 2.2:**

                    For synchronous requests (sync=true):

                    - If all generated images fail moderation, returns a 422
                    error

                    - If some images pass and others fail, returns a 200

        **Description**


        This Vector Generation pipeline enables builders to integrate the
        generation of high-quality, editable vector graphic assets into their
        products or workflows. It leverages Bria’s proprietary text-to-image
        foundation models, enhanced to produce vector-compatible outputs while
        maintaining control and flexibility. The pipeline supports generation of
        scalable assets such as icons, logos, and illustrations, making it ideal
        for use cases requiring vector graphics.



        **Examples:**


        **prompt**: A sticker of a cute kitten

         This API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked input image will fail the entire request.

        **Description**


        This Vector Generation pipeline is optimized for speed, enabling
        builders to quickly integrate the generation of high-quality, editable
        vector graphic assets into their products or workflows. It leverages
        Bria’s proprietary text-to-image foundation models, enhanced to
        accelerate output while maintaining control and flexibility. The
        pipeline supports generation of scalable assets such as icons, logos,
        and illustrations, making it ideal for use cases that require rapid
        delivery of vector graphics.


        **Examples:**


        **prompt**: An icon of a bird with a blue head and yellow beak against a
        solid background


        <img src="https://i.ibb.co/DG73T97/bird-icon-1.png" width="200"
        height="200"/> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/WcySnrr/bird-icon-3.png"
        width="200" height="200"/> <img

        width="200" height="200"/>

        This API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter
        that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate
        content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked
        input image will fail the entire request.

        **Description**


        The `/reimagine` endpoint in Bria’s API allows guiding image generation
        not just with prompts but also by using an input image. This feature
        retains the original structure and depth of the input while
        incorporating new materials, colors, and textures to create fresh
        visuals.

        ### Key Benefits

        - **Simplified Structure Guidance**: Use a reference image to replicate
        its outline and depth, reducing the need for complex prompts and
        minimizing trial and error.


        - **Versatile Input/Output Pairings**:
            - Convert illustrations, sketches, or photos into new illustrative outputs.
            - Transform photos into variations that maintain the original layout.
            
        - **Adjustable Structure Influence**: Control how much the input image's
        structure impacts the output on a scale from 0 to 1, allowing for
        diverse creative results.


        - **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Ensures the output maintains the
        reference image's aspect ratio for layout consistency. The output
        resolution is approximately 1 megapixel.


        - **Seamless Integration with Tailored Generation**: Combine structural
        references with tailored models to include unique IP characteristics in
        the generated outputs. 

        ### Potential Use Cases

        **Enhanced Creative Control for Platforms & Editing Tools**


        Empower creative platforms and editing tools with advanced levels of
        control and flexibility for generating visual content.

        - **Maintain Spatial Consistency**

        This API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter
        that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate
        content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked
        input image will fail the entire request.

                    immediately providing URLs for images that are generated in
                    the background. Use polling for the URLs to retrieve images

                    generation.  If the prompt violates Bria's ethical

                    For input images:

                    - Processing stops at the first image that fails moderation

                    - Returns a 422 error with details about which parameter
                    failed


                    For synchronous requests (sync=true):

                    - If all generated images fail moderation, returns a 422
                    error

                    - If some images pass and others fail, returns a 200
                    response with successful generations and "blocked" objects
                    for failed ones


                    For asynchronous requests (sync=false):

                    - Failed images are replaced with zero-byte files at their
                    placeholder URLs

                    - Successful images are stored at their original placeholder

                    optional. When the training data was minimal or less
                    diverse, lower the influence to improve flexibility in the

                    This is relevant only when a tailored model is being used.
                    When true, the model's generation prefix is automatically
                    prepended to your prompt to maintain consistency with the
                    training data, while false allows you to override the
                    training prefix and write the complete prompt yourself,
                    including any preferred prefix text.

        **Description**


        The /prompt_enhancer route is designed to boost users' creativity by
        transforming simple prompts into more detailed and vivid descriptions.
        This helps generate richer, more diverse images. (It is also available
        as a built-in flag in all of our /text-to-image routes, excluding
        tailored generation.)


        We recommend using this feature by offering users a range of prompts to
        choose from before generating an image, enabling them to explore
        creative ideas.


        *Works best with short to medium prompts of up to approximately 50
        words.


        **Examples:**


        **original prompt**: A cat

        width="200" height="200"/> 


        **enhanced prompt**: A black and white photograph of a sophisticated
        Siamese cat, sitting in a chair next to a large window, with the urban
        cityscape visible in the background

        **Description**


        Generates a new image based on your inputs.


        This all-in-one endpoint first translates your input (`prompt` and/or
        `images`) into a structured JSON prompt using the state-of-the-art
        **Gemini 2.5 Flash** VLM bridge. It then *internally* uses that JSON to
        generate the final, deterministic image.


        Use this endpoint for professional workflows that demand the
        highest-fidelity interpretation of your creative vision. The response
        includes both the final `image_url` and the `structured_prompt` (JSON).


        For advanced, programmatic control, you can also pass in your own
        `structured_prompt` (e.g., from a previous response or the
        `/v2/structured_prompt/generate` endpoint) to bypass the internal VLM
        bridge. This allows for precise, auditable refinement or recreation of
        an image, or to generate multiple variations from the same structured
        prompt.


        ---


        **Input Combination Rules**


        The request body must include **one** of the following mutually
        exclusive combinations:


        * `prompt` (Generates a new image from text)

        * `images` (Generates a new image inspired by a reference image)

        * `images` + `prompt` (Generates a new image inspired by an image and
        guided by text)

        * `structured_prompt` (Recreates a previous image exactly, combined with
        a seed)

        * `structured_prompt` + `prompt` (Refines a previous image using new
        text instructions, combined with a seed)

      summary: Generate Structured Prompt
      tags:

      description: >
        Creates a new detailed, machine-readable structured prompt in JSON
        format or refines an existing one using text or image inputs.


        This endpoint uses the state-of-the-art **Gemini 2.5 Flash** VLM bridge
        to generate the prompt, providing superior understanding of nuanced or
        complex inputs. It **only returns the JSON string** and does not
        generate an image.


        **Why use this endpoint?**


        This endpoint decouples the "intent translation" step from the "image
        generation" step, giving you maximum flexibility.


        * **It's Optional:** The same structured prompt generation happens
        automatically behind the scenes when using `/v2/image/generate`.

        * **Control & Auditability:** Allows for a "human-in-the-loop" to
        inspect, programmatically edit, or version the JSON *before* generating
        an image (e.g., for a custom UI).

        * **Consistency & Automation:** Generate one `structured_prompt` and
        pass it to `/v2/image/generate` multiple times to create consistent,
        auditable variations.

        * **Hybrid Deployment:** Use Bria's state-of-the-art VLM bridge via API
        while self-hosting the open-source FIBO image model on your own private
        cloud.


        The resulting `structured_prompt` can be used as input for the
        `/v2/image/generate` endpoint.


        **Input Combination Rules**


        The request body must use exactly one of the following combinations:

        * **Text Only**: `prompt`

        * **Image Only**: `images`

        * **Image and Text**: `images` and `prompt`

        * **Structured Prompt and Text**: `structured_prompt` and `prompt`

        **Description**


        Generates a new image based on your inputs using the **Fibo Lite
        Pipeline**.


        This all-in-one endpoint utilizes a two-step local-compatible process:

        1. **FIBO-VLM Bridge:** Translates your input (`prompt` and/or `images`)
        into a structured JSON prompt using Bria's open-source VLM.

        2. **Fibo Lite Model:** Internally uses the distilled Fibo Lite
        text-to-image model to generate the final visual based on that JSON.


        **Fibo Lite's Benefit**


        By pairing the distilled Fibo Lite text-to-image model with the FIBO-VLM
        bridge, the entire pipeline is capable of fully local, on-prem
        deployment.


        To access the local deployment package, please contact us at <a
        href="mailto:support@bria.ai">support@bria.ai</a>.


        For advanced, programmatic control, you can also pass in your own
        `structured_prompt` (e.g., from a previous response or the
        `/v2/structured_prompt/generate/lite` endpoint) to bypass the internal
        VLM bridge. This allows for precise, auditable refinement or recreation
        of an image, or to generate multiple variations from the same structured
        prompt.


        ---


        **Input Combination Rules**


        The request body must include **one** of the following mutually
        exclusive combinations:


        * `prompt` (Generates a new image from text)

        * `images` (Generates a new image inspired by a reference image)

        * `images` + `prompt` (Generates a new image inspired by an image and
        guided by text)

        * `structured_prompt` (Recreates a previous image exactly, combined with
        a seed)

        * `structured_prompt` + `prompt` (Refines a previous image using new
        text instructions, combined with a seed)

      summary: Generate Structured Prompt - Lite (Coming Soon)
      tags:
        - v2 endpoints
      servers:
        - url: https://engine.prod.bria-api.com/v2
      description: >
        Creates a new detailed, machine-readable structured prompt in JSON
        format or refines an existing one using text or image inputs.


        This endpoint uses Bria's standard **FIBO-VLM** bridge (open-source,
        available on Hugging Face) to generate the prompt. It **only returns the
        JSON string** and does not generate an image.


        **Why use this endpoint?**


        This endpoint decouples the "intent translation" step from the "image
        generation" step, giving you maximum flexibility.


        * **It's Optional:** The same structured prompt generation happens
        automatically behind the scenes when using `/v2/image/generate/lite`.

        * **Control & Auditability:** Allows for a "human-in-the-loop" to
        inspect, programmatically edit, or version the JSON *before* generating
        an image (e.g., for a custom UI).

        * **Consistency & Automation:** Generate one `structured_prompt` and
        pass it to `/v2/image/generate/lite` multiple times to create
        consistent, auditable variations.

        * **Hybrid Deployment:** Use Bria's API for the VLM bridge while
        self-hosting the open-source FIBO image model on your own private cloud.


        The resulting `structured_prompt` can be used as input for the
        `/v2/image/generate/lite` endpoint.


        **Input Combination Rules**


        The request body must use exactly one of the following combinations:

        * **Text Only**: `prompt`

        * **Image Only**: `images`

        * **Image and Text**: `images` and `prompt`

        * **Structured Prompt and Text**: `structured_prompt` and `prompt`
