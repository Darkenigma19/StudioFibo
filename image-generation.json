    "description": "Bria’s Image Generation API provides builders with a flexible and controllable way to generate high-quality visuals from textual prompts or reference images.\nIt supports various resolutions, aspect ratios, and generation speeds, enabling scalable and efficient production of photos, illustrations, and vector graphics for commercial use.\n\n**API Access**\n\nYou can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform <a href=\"https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys\" target=\"_blank\">by clicking here</a>.\n\n\nOur latest image generation API (V2) is built around **FIBO**, a next-gen visual model trained on structured JSON descriptions of images for precise, controllable generation. These endpoints utilize a two-step process:\n1.  A **VLM Bridge** translates your input (text/images) into a detailed, machine-readable `structured_prompt` (JSON).\n2.  The **FIBO image model** generates the final image based on the `structured_prompt`.\n\nThese APIa offers two VLM bridge options:\n* **Gemini 2.5 Flash:** Used by the `/image/generate` endpoints for state-of-the-art, detailed prompt creation.\n* **FIBO-VLM (Open):** (Coming Soon) Used by the `/image/generate/lite` endpoints as part of the Fibo Lite Pipeline. By pairing the distilled Fibo Lite text-to-image model with the FIBO-VLM bridge, the entire pipeline is capable of fully local, on-prem deployment. To learn more, contact us at <a href=\"mailto:support@bria.ai\">support@bria.ai</a>.\n\nYou can use the all-in-one `/image/generate` endpoints or decouple these steps using the `/structured_prompt/generate` endpoints for maximum control and automation. See the **v2 endpoints** tag description below for more details.\n\n**V1 Endpoints:**\nWe also provide access to our previous generation (V1) endpoints. These offer distinct pipelines like Base, Fast, HD, Vector generation, and Reimagine. Some V1 endpoints support unique **Guidance Methods** like ControlNets. See the **v1 endpoints** tag description below for details on these legacy features.\n\n\n**IP-related prompts**\nOur models are trained exclusively on fully licensed, safe-for-commercial-use data.\nPrompts that reference public figures, brands, or other protected content may result in generic or altered outputs.\nThese prompts are not blocked, but results may differ from what you expect.\nIf an IP-related signal is detected in the prompt, the following warning will appear in the API response:\n```text\n  This prompt may contain intellectual property (IP)-protected content. \n  To ensure compliance and safety, certain elements may be omitted or altered. \n  As a result, the output may not fully meet your request.\n  ```\n\n\n**Advanced Customization and Access:**\nAs part of Bria’s **Source Code & Weights** product, developers seeking deeper customization can access Bria’s source-available GenAI models via [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/briaai).\nThis allows full control over fine-tuning, pipeline creation, and integration into proprietary workflows—empowering AI teams to develop and optimize their own generative AI solutions.\n"

When you make an asynchronous request, the API immediately returns a `request_id` and a `status_url` instead of the final result. Use the Status Service to track the request's progress until it reaches a completed state.\n\n  See the full guide at [Status Service Documentation](https://docs.bria.ai/status) for complete details and usage examples.\n\n  **API Access**\n\n  You can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform <a href=\"https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys\" target=\"_blank\">by clicking here</a>.\n"

It leverages Bria’s proprietary text-to-image foundation models, combined with performance-oriented enhancements that ensure faster generation while maintaining control and flexibility. The pipeline supports native generation at 1MP resolution and accommodates a wide range of aspect ratios, making it ideal for applications that require quick turnaround with consistent output control.\n\n\n**An example:**\n\n**prompt**: A portrait of a Beautiful and playful ethereal singer, art deco, fantasy, intricate art deco golden designs, elegant, highly detailed, sharp focus, blurry background, teal and orange shades\n\n**BRIA FAST model 2.3:**\n\n<img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/api_doc/fast/image+(42).png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://images.bria.ai/images/b0788963e23ce367.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/api_doc/fast/image+(43).png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://images.bria.ai/images/cdee459b344d1a31.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>    \nThis API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked input image will fail the entire request.",

It leverages Bria’s proprietary text-to-image foundation models, enhanced to deliver high-resolution outputs while preserving control and flexibility. The pipeline supports native generation at 1920×1080 resolution (or 1536×1536 for square aspect ratios) and accommodates a wide range of aspect ratios, making it ideal for use cases where visual precision and output quality are critical.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**prompt**: A photo of detailed short female blond hair viewed from behind, with rich texture and clearly visible individual strands that give depth and realism, and featuring subtle waves reflect light\n\n**BRIA HD model 2.2:**\n\n<img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/api_doc/hd/seed_459779534.png\" width=\"400\"/> <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/api_doc/hd/seed_939823113.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n\n**prompt**: A portrait of a Beautiful and playful ethereal singer, art deco, fantasy, intricate art deco golden designs, elegant, highly detailed, sharp focus, blurry background, teal and orange shades\n\n**BRIA HD model 2.2:**\n\n<img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/api_doc/hd/image+(42).png\" width=\"400\"/> <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/api_doc/hd/image+(50).png\" width=\"400\"/>\nThis API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter that filters out unsafe generated images.

It leverages Bria’s proprietary text-to-image foundation models, enhanced to produce vector-compatible outputs while maintaining control and flexibility. The pipeline supports generation of scalable assets such as icons, logos, and illustrations, making it ideal for use cases requiring vector graphics.\n\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**prompt**: A sticker of a cute kitten\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/FBd4Cwj/sticker-of-a-cute-kitten-ec34b3c9918ecec1.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dcNzBYR/kitten-2.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/WcgDjsx/kitten-4.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/YT66fGv/kitten-5.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n\n**prompt**: A beautiful butterfly\n\n\n <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/1sRxRvp/butterfly-1.png\" width=\"266\" height=\"200\"/><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Gxm7X9J/4-butterflies.png\" width=\"266\" height=\"200\"/>\n\n\n On the left, a generated vector illustration. On the right, the same illustration after being re-colored in a vector editor\n\n This API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked input image will fail the entire request.",

The pipeline supports generation of scalable assets such as icons, logos, and illustrations, making it ideal for use cases that require rapid delivery of vector graphics.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**prompt**: An icon of a bird with a blue head and yellow beak against a solid background\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/DG73T97/bird-icon-1.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/WcySnrr/bird-icon-3.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/hsLcs04/bird-icon-2.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/6R99kxp/bird-icon-4.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\nThis API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked input image will fail the entire request.",

This feature retains the original structure and depth of the input while incorporating new materials, colors, and textures to create fresh visuals.\n### Key Benefits\n- **Simplified Structure Guidance**: Use a reference image to replicate its outline and depth, reducing the need for complex prompts and minimizing trial and error.\n\n- **Versatile Input/Output Pairings**:\n    - Convert illustrations, sketches, or photos into new illustrative outputs.\n    - Transform photos into variations that maintain the original layout.\n    \n- **Adjustable Structure Influence**: Control how much the input image's structure impacts the output on a scale from 0 to 1, allowing for diverse creative results.\n\n- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Ensures the output maintains the reference image's aspect ratio for layout consistency. The output resolution is approximately 1 megapixel.\n\n- **Seamless Integration with Tailored Generation**: Combine structural references with tailored models to include unique IP characteristics in the generated outputs. \n### Potential Use Cases\n**Enhanced Creative Control for Platforms & Editing Tools**\n\nEmpower creative platforms and editing tools with advanced levels of control and flexibility for generating visual content.\n- **Maintain Spatial Consistency**\n  \n  Structure reference image\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/Untitled+design+(10)+(1).png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n  \n  \n  Generated Visual (combined into a gif)\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/ezgif-3-6a1c2d26ed+(1).gif\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n- **Convert Sketches to Illustrations**\n  \n  Structure reference image\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/iStock-1507967542+(1).jpg\" height=\"200\"/>\n  \n  prompt: A watercolor painting of a lively urban street featuring a red vintage car parked in front of multi-story buildings, where soft, fluid brushstrokes capture the subtle gradients in the building facades, with warm earth tones blending into cool blues and grays for the shadows, giving the scene a nostalgic and dreamy atmosphere.\n  \n  structure_ref_influence: 0.75\n  \n  Generated Visual\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/A_watercolor_painting_of_a_lively_urban_street_featuring_a_red_vintage_car_parke_undefined+(2).png\" height=\"200\"/>\n- **Generate Diverse Variations**\n  \n  Structure reference image\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/cute-scottish-straight-kitten-playing-with-balls-o-2023-11-27-05-13-57-utc+(1)+(1).jpg\" height=\"200\"/>\n  \n  prompt: A ginger kitten sits on a textured beige surface, surrounded by soft balls of yarn.\n  \n  structure_ref_influence: 0.75\n  \n  Generated Visual\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/seed_1405021285.png\" height=\"200\"/>\n- **Stylize Typography and Logos**\n  \n  Structure reference image\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/BRIA+(1)+(1).png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n  \n  prompt: curled orange peel.\n  \n  structure_ref_influence: 0.1\n  \n  Generated Visual\n  \n  <img src=\"https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/reimagine/curled_orange_peel_undefined+(1).png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n\n**Interoperability with Tailored Generation**\n- **Reskin Gaming Assets**: Maintain the structure and detail of assets while updating textures and colors for fresh looks without altering the original shape or layout.\n\n- **Iterate on Gaming Asset Designs**: Simplifies design iteration for gaming assets, enabling rapid exploration and refinement.\n\n- **Customize Marketing Assets**: Transform marketing visuals while preserving their composition, adding new styles and elements with structural guidance.\n\n- **Adapt User-Generated Content**: Repurpose user-generated content for marketing campaigns, making it fit seamlessly with brand aesthetics.\n\n**For practical tips, view our guide [here](https://www.notion.so/134ba153467980a28d25de394f651c4a?pvs=21).**\nThis API endpoint supports content moderation via an optional parameter that can prevent generation if input images contain inappropriate content, and filters out unsafe generated images - the first blocked input image will fail the entire request.",

This helps generate richer, more diverse images.

It then *internally* uses that JSON to generate the final, deterministic image.\n\nUse this endpoint for professional workflows that demand the highest-fidelity interpretation of your creative vision. The response includes both the final `image_url` and the `structured_prompt` (JSON).\n\nFor advanced, programmatic control, you can also pass in your own `structured_prompt` (e.g., from a previous response or the `/v2/structured_prompt/generate` endpoint) to bypass the internal VLM bridge. This allows for precise, auditable refinement or recreation of an image, or to generate multiple variations from the same structured prompt.\n\n---\n\n**Input Combination Rules**\n\nThe request body must include **one** of the following mutually exclusive combinations:\n\n* `prompt` (Generates a new image from text)\n* `images` (Generates a new image inspired by a reference image)\n* `images` + `prompt` (Generates a new image inspired by an image and guided by text)\n* `structured_prompt` (Recreates a previous image exactly, combined with a seed)\n* `structured_prompt` + `prompt` (Refines a previous image using new text instructions, combined with a seed)\n\n---\n**API Access**\n\nYou can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform <a href=\"https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys\" target=\"_blank\">by clicking here</a>.\n\n---\n***Examples***\n\n**Use Case 1: Using a textual prompt**\n\n* **Input Prompt:** `photorealistic, high resolution rendering, balloon of lettering, \"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026\", used color is Pantone Bran, Crocus, Deja vu blue, perfect composition and alignment, natural light set, white backdrop, ultra realistic, rich detail`\n* **Output Image:** ![Example of text-to-image output](https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/fibo/new_year_2026.png)\n* **Output `structured_prompt`:**\n    ```json\n    \n    {\n      \"short_description\": \"A photorealistic, high-resolution rendering of balloon lettering spelling out \\\"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026\\\" against a pristine white backdrop.

This allows for precise, auditable refinement or recreation of an image, or to generate multiple variations from the same structured prompt.\n\n---\n\n**Input Combination Rules**\n\nThe request body must include **one** of the following mutually exclusive combinations:\n\n* `prompt` (Generates a new image from text)\n* `images` (Generates a new image inspired by a reference image)\n* `images` + `prompt` (Generates a new image inspired by an image and guided by text)\n* `structured_prompt` (Recreates a previous image exactly, combined with a seed)\n* `structured_prompt` + `prompt` (Refines a previous image using new text instructions, combined with a seed)\n\n---\n** API Access **\n\nYou can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform <a href=\"https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys\" target=\"_blank\">by clicking here</a>.\n\n---\n***Examples***\n\n**Use Case 1: Using a textual prompt**\n\n* **Input Prompt:** `photorealistic, high resolution rendering, balloon of lettering, \"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026\", used color is Pantone Bran, Crocus, Deja vu blue, perfect composition and alignment, natural light set, white backdrop, ultra realistic, rich detail`\n* **Output Image:** ![Example of text-to-image output](https://bria-datasets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_doc/fibo-lite/new_year_2026.png)\n* **Output `structured_prompt`:**\n    ```json\n    \n    {\n      \"short_description\": \"A photorealistic, high-resolution rendering of balloon lettering spelling out \\\"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026\\\" against a pristine white background.

It **only returns the JSON string** and does not generate an image.\n\n**Why use this endpoint?**\n\nThis endpoint decouples the \"intent translation\" step from the \"image generation\" step, giving you maximum flexibility.\n\n* **It's Optional:** The same structured prompt generation happens automatically behind the scenes when using `/v2/image/generate/lite`.\n* **Control & Auditability:** Allows for a \"human-in-the-loop\" to inspect, programmatically edit, or version the JSON *before* generating an image (e.g., for a custom UI).\n* **Consistency & Automation:** Generate one `structured_prompt` and pass it to `/v2/image/generate/lite` multiple times to create consistent, auditable variations.\n* **Hybrid Deployment:** Use Bria's API for the VLM bridge while self-hosting the open-source FIBO image model on your own private cloud.\n\nThe resulting `structured_prompt` can be used as input for the `/v2/image/generate/lite` endpoint.\n\n**Input Combination Rules**\n\nThe request body must use exactly one of the following combinations:\n* **Text Only**: `prompt`\n* **Image Only**: `images`\n* **Image and Text**: `images` and `prompt`\n* **Structured Prompt and Text**: `structured_prompt` and `prompt`\n\n---\n** API Access **\n\nYou can register and access the API Token through Bria's platform <a href=\"https://platform.bria.ai/console/account/api-keys\" target=\"_blank\">by clicking here</a>.\n",
